1.4:	First public beta release.
1.5:	Added "-b" option for complete carving compability with
	foremost 0.69.
1.51:	Fixed a problem with Scalpel not carving all files near the end of
	some large images. The locations of the files was detected, but an
	optimization to minimize reads on pass 2 caused the files not to
	be written (and not to be noted in the Scalpel log).  Also, more
	work to bring the Win32 version into compliance.  Fixed problem
	with Win32 version reporting "Couldn't measure size of image file"
	for large images--required ftello64()/fseeko64() under mingw.
	40+GB images have now been carved successfully under Win32.  Fixed
	format of offset in log file for large offsets under Win32; the
	printf() implementation in mingw under Windows doesn't support
	"%llu" for unsigned long long integers--needs "%I64u".  Blech.
1.52	Foremost 0.69 didn't discover overlapping headers/footers.  If you want
	this behavior, use "-r" on the command line.  Scalpel's default
	behavior is now to discover all headers/footers, even if they
	overlap.  Different Quicktime needles (from the 'file' command's
	magic file) are now used in the configuration file, because the
	default Foremost needles didn't seem to match valid Quicktime
	files.  The needles are still weak, in that they cause a bunch of
	false positives.  The configuration file now uses more
	reasonable (in my opinion) maximum carve sizes.  By default, all
	file types are still commented out.
1.53	Verbose mode implemented.  "-v" outputs copious (too much?) information
	about what Scalpel is doing as files are carved.  Mac OS X is now
	supported, including the use of raw block devices
	(e.g., /dev/disk0) as carve targets.  Use "make bsd" for an OS X
	compilation.  NOTE: As of version 2.0, this support is now
	deprecated, but may be reintroduced in the future.
1.54	Maximum size for carved files is now 18 exabytes. Minor changes to
	Makefile. Fixed minor formatting problem in audit log.  Scalpel
	man page created.  Eliminated duplicate error messages when
	targets could not be opened.  Thanks to John Vigo for additional
	MAC OS X testing on this release.
1.60	Changes in this release include:

	o Some of the headers and footers in the default
	'scalpel.conf' file have been improved.  In particular, the
	GIF89 footer was made less restrictive; GIF89 files were
	encountered in the wild for which the legacy Foremost footer
	was too restrictive.

	o REVERSE carving semantics now fixed as "helpers.c"
	functions continue to evolve from their Foremost roots; this
	is mostly useful for PDF carving and when some carved files
	appear to be truncated--e.g., many times GIF files will
	contain the footer string internally and with FORWARD carving,
	will be truncated.  REVERSE carving can help, but at the
	expense of occasionally carving overly large files.

	o Removed obsolete option "-f".

	o Maximum number of files that can be carved per file type is
	now 18,446,744,073,709,551,616.  This is also the maximum
	number of files of all combined types that can be carved in
	a single run.  This is unlikely to be a problematic upper
	bound in the near term.

	o The "-q" command line option is now available to force
	block-aligned carving; only files with headers that begin on
	block boundaries are carved.  The block size for this mode is
	user-specified.

	o The "-r" option was not accepted in recent releases due to
	an omission in Scalpel's command line argument parsing.  This
	option isn't generally used except for compatibility testing
	with Foremost 0.69 (it actually forces Scalpel to mimic some
	buggy Foremost behavior) and should be considered deprecated.
	In a future release of Scalpel, it will be removed.

	o Scalpel now organizes carved files into subdirectories by
	type (and for each type, additional subdirectories are created
	with a maximum of MAX_FILES_PER_SUBDIRECTORY [default: 5000]
	files each).  This will allow you to more comfortably explore
	the set of carved files using the Windows or Linux file
	explorers without having them choke on large subdirectories.
	The files are organized within the Scalpel output directory
	into subdirectories with the following naming convention:

	suffix-rule#-counter
	suffix-rule#-counter
	...
	suffix-rule#-counter

	where 'suffix' matches the suffix specified in the Scalpel
	configuration file (e.g, "jpg"), 'rule#' is the index of the
	corresponding rule in the configuration file (with the first
	uncommented rule being 0), and 'counter' being incremented after
	every MAX_FILES_PER_SUBDIRECTORY files corresponding to a rule are
	carved.

	You can turn off this default organization by using the "-O"
	command line flag (then Scalpel acts as in previous releases
	and dumps all carved files into a single output directory).  

	o The "-p" performs a "preview" carve, creating an audit file
	indicating which files would be carved, but without performing
	carving operations.  This substantially increases execution speed
	and also supports "in-line" carving, when used in conjunction with
	our custom FUSE filesystem.

	o A memory corruption error when Scalpel had large numbers of
	files open (typically, when a large number of file types were
	specified in the configuration file) was corrected.  Thanks to
	both Doug Koster and Peter Theobald for pointing out this error.

	o In this release some unused functions were removed
	from the Scalpel source.

	o A bug which arose for case-insensitive header/footer
	specifications in the legacy Foremost Boyer-Moore string
	search initialization was corrected.  Thanks to Doug Koster
	for pointing out this bug.

	o Fixed (slightly) garbled invocation string in audit file; this
	resulted from an unitialized string in legacy Foremost code.

	o The "-d", "-m", "-t", and "-u" options are experimental and are
	part of evolving support for interaction between Scalpel and
	external tools, with the goal being better support for recovery
	of fragmented files.   Please contact the author -->
	golden@digitalforensicssolutions.com <-- for more information if
	these options appear useful to you.  More information will be provided
	when the necessary external tools are released.
1.70	Changes in this release include:

	Multithreading for multi-core CPUs.  Threading models are selected
	at compile-time, in scalpel.h.  Multithreading is supported on all
	platforms.
1.9 	Support for regular expressions in headers and footers implemented.
	Multithreaded header/footer searches are now supported.
1.91    -e option added, min carve sizes now supported, fixed pathname issues 
	for header/footer database, more cleanup of error handling code
	and audit file processing, and a copy of the config file is now
	included in audit log to document the options used during a
	carving job.
2.0	Public release, with multithreading, asynchronous I/O, regular expression
	support, minimum carve sizes.  Blockmap features are currently
	removed, since they are being rewritten.  We have also deprecated
	the -s option, since it is broken.  A new skip option based on
	blockmaps will be introduced in the next major release and will
	allow specific areas of disk images to be targeted for carving.
