********************************************************************

As of 6/27/2013 Scalpel has been released under the Apache 2.0 License
and the source is available at The Sleuth Kit github repository.

It is not being actively maintained.  The Autopsy team started to do
work on it to integrate tightly into via Java/JNI bindings, but ran
into several memory leaks and the effort was abandoned. 

No official releases are being made. You can submit pull requests, 
but they may take a while to get reviewed. 

********************************************************************

Scalpel is a file carving and indexing application that runs on Linux
and Windows.  The first version of Scalpel, released in 2005, was
based on Foremost 0.69. There have been a number of internal releases
since the last public release, 1.60, primarily to support our own
research.  The newest public release v2.0, has a number of additional
features, including:

o minimum carve sizes.

o multithreading for quicker execution on multicore CPUs.

o asynchronous I/O that allows disk operations to overlap with pattern
matching--this results in a substantial performance improvement.

o regular expression support for headers/footers.

o embedded header/footer matching for better processing of structured
file types that may contain embedded files.

o for advanced users, support for massively-threaded execution on
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).  This feature is available only on
Linux and requires installation of the NVIDIA CUDA SDK, modification
of scalpel.h to enable the GPU threading mode, and compilation with
the CUDA toolchain.  Our implementation also requires an NVIDIA GPU
with compute capability >= 1.2, so older CUDA-capable cards probably
won't work.  The NVIDIA GTX 260 is relatively inexpensive and powerful
and has the appropriate compute capability.  The GPU-enhanced version
of Scalpel is able to do preview carving at rates that exceed the disk
bandwidth of most file servers, so for big jobs, it may be worth the
extra effort required to use this feature.  Note that regular
expression-based headers and footers are NOT currently supported when
GPU acceleration is in use!  We might address this in a future
release.

Scalpel performs file carving operations based on patterns that
describe particular file or data fragment "types".  These patterns may
be based on either fixed binary strings or regular expressions.  A
number of default patterns are included in the configuration file
included in the distribution, "scalpel.conf".  The comments in the
configuration file explain the format of the file carving patterns
supported by Scalpel.

Important note: The default configuration file, "scalpel.conf", has
all supported file patterns commented out--you must edit this file
before running Scalpel to activate some patterns.  Resist the urge to
simply uncomment all file carving patterns; this wastes time and will
generate a huge number of false positives.  Instead, uncomment only
the patterns for the file types you need.

To run scalpel, "scalpel.conf" must be specified in the current working 
direcotry.

Scalpel options are described in the Scalpel man page, "scalpel.1".
You may also execute Scalpel w/o any command line arguments to see a
list of options.


COMPILATION PREREQUISITES:

NOTE: Compilation is necessary on Unix platforms and on Mac OS X.

o For Mac OS X, these four package is needed for build dependencies - 
autoconf, automake, libtool, tre. You can install these package through 
homebrew by running `brew install autoconf automake libtool tre`.

o For Linux, these package is required - make, autoconf, automake, 
libtool, tre. Use any method to install these package. If you are using 
Debian-like linux, you can install them through `apt-get` by running 
`apt-get install make autoconf automake libtool tre-agrep libtre5 
libtre-dev`.

o For Windows platforms, a precompiled scalpel.exe is provided.  If you do
wish to recompile Scalpel on Windows, you'll need a mingw (gcc)
setup. Scalpel will not compile using Visual Studio C compilers.  Note
that our compilation environment for Windows is currently 32-bit; we
haven't tested on the 64-bit version of mingw, but will address this
int the future.


COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS ON SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:

Linux/Mac OS X:    
% ./bootstrap
% ./configure 
% make

Windows (mingw):
cd src 
mingw32-make -f Makefile.win


and enjoy.  If you want to install the binary and man page in a more
permanent place, just copy "scalpel" (or "scalpel.exe") and
"scalpel.1" to appropriate locations, e.g., on Linux, "/usr/local/bin"
and "/usr/local/man/man1", respectively.  On Windows, you'll also need
to copy the pthreads and tre regular expression library dlls into the
same directory as "scalpel.exe".


OTHER SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

We are not currently supporting Scalpel on Unix variants other than
Linux. Go ahead and try a ./configure and make and see what happens,
but be sure to do thorough testing before using Scalpel in production
work.  If you are interested in supporting a version of Scalpel on an
alternate platforms, please contact us.  If you are interested in
supporting a GPU-enhanced version of Scalpel on Windows, we are also
interesting in hearing from you.


LIMITATIONS:

Carving Windows physical and logical device files (e.g.,
\\.\physicaldrive0 or \\.\c:) isn't currently supported because it
requires us to rewrite some portions of Scalpel to use Windows file
I/O functions rather than standard Unix calls.  This may be supported
in a future release.

Block map features are currently disabled, as we are rewriting this
subsystem to enhance interoperability with the Sleuthkit.  An improved
version of the block map features will return in a subsequent release.
The -s command line option ("skip") has been removed and will be
replaced with a more robust facility in the next major release.


DEPENDENCIES:

Scalpel uses the POSIX threads library and depends on the POSIX 
compliant regexp matching library `tre`.

On Win32, Scalpel is distributed with the Pthreads-win32 - POSIX Threads 
Library for Win32, which is Copyright(C) 1998 John E. Bossom and 
Copyright(C) 1999,2005 by Pthreads-win32 contributors.  This library 
is licensed under the LGPL.

Scalpel for Win32 uses the tre regular expression library and is
distributed with tre-0.7.5, which is licensed under the LGPL.
